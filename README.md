#Jira Client
This is mainly project created to accomplish two goals: Learn Fuse and scratch my own itch.
Jira is something I use a lot on my work but haven't really found a mobile solution that fits my needs or pleasant to work with, so I decided to create my own solution in Fuse.

The closest to what I want to achieve is probably the official JIRA app for iOS, but then again, it's only available for that operating system and I wanted to create something that could be useful for both, iOS and Android users.

Because is also a _discovering project_ I wanted to create it using ES2015, so I'm using Babel to transform it to ES5 since Fuse doesn't support ES2015 just yet.

It also uses ESLint for Javascript linting.

If you wan to work on this, or want to play with it, follow these simple steps:

1. Open a terminal
2. Go to the folder where you cloned/downloaded this project
3. Install the npm packages with `npm install` or `npm i`
3. Once the packages are installed run `npm start`

I also run the preview using the terminal but that's up to you.

Enjoy!

All suggestions are welcome.
